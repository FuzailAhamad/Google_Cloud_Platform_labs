# Google_Cloud_Platform_labs

Welcome to the Google Cloud Platform Labs repository! This repository contains various labs and projects that demonstrate the capabilities and services offered by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). These labs are designed to help you get hands-on experience with GCP and to showcase how different GCP services can be used in real-world scenarios. This repository provides a collection of labs that cover various GCP services such as Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and more. Each lab is designed to be self-contained and includes detailed instructions on how to set up and complete the tasks.

To get started with these labs, you will need a Google Cloud account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a free trial. Each lab will have its own set of instructions and requirements, so be sure to read through them carefully before starting.

The repository is organized into directories, each representing a different lab or project. Here are some of the labs included in this repository: Compute Engine Basics - Learn how to create and manage virtual machines on Google Compute Engine. Cloud Storage - Explore how to use Google Cloud Storage to store and manage data. BigQuery - Understand how to use BigQuery for data analytics and querying large datasets. Cloud Functions - Discover how to create and deploy serverless functions using Cloud Functions. Kubernetes Engine - Get hands-on with Google Kubernetes Engine for container orchestration.
